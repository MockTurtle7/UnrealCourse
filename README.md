## TODO

### Bull-Cow Game

	1. Make a dictionary map, and randomize the hidden word.
		* Set up the difficulty levels, so that the player can choose the length of the hidden word.
		* Find a library or a dictionary of isograms.
		* The map will contain the isograms and their corresponding hints.

	4. Implement the hint, which can be used one time a game, regardless to the difficulty. It prints out the second value from the map.

	3. Implement longer isograms i.e. 17 letters.

	4. Scoring system using substraction of the total, e.g. the correct answer at Try 1 of 5 gives you 500 pts; the correct answer at Try 4 of 5 gives you 200 pts.
		* Print out the score at the end of the game.

### EscapeRoom

	1. Watch and follow the lectures.
